# Scoundrel Squad Code

Scoundrel Squad is a tactical roguelike game made in Unity for PC, in which the player controls a squad of four characters. The goal of the game is to reach the top of the building. Gameplay consists of finding a way through procedurally generated levels, fighting enemies, and collecting loot. Items in the game include currency, weapons, ammo, and equipment, including macrochips, which are cybernetic augments for your characters that grant passive boosts to their stats or active tactical abilities. Characters have a slot based inventory, and various stats that affect their utility in different situations. The game is playable, but somewhat unpolished. A playable prototype release is available.

Notable parts of the code include the level generation system, and the equipment system. Both utilize scriptable objects to easily create and iterate on content in the Unity editor. The level generation system is part of my Bachelor's of IT thesis on procedural level generation.

This repo contains most of the custom scripts for the game. Some asset store packages and other assets are not included.

The code has some random naming policies, lack of comments, and confusing structures here and there. It could definitely use some more refactoring and documentation.
